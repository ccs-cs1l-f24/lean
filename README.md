The files in this repository are proofs of certain facts in lean, including the irrationality of $\sqrt{2}$ and that there are infinitely many primes. To run these lean programs, download the files given in the repository and load them into a lean environment.

Note that these files only represent proofs and do not have the required dependencies for "running" them as programs.

One way to run these files to verify them is to load them in the following online lean interpreter: https://live.lean-lang.org/

To do this, download the files from this repository and load them using the load button in the top right corner of the lean interpreter window.

The WRITEUP.md file has a more in-depth writeup of the process of creating these programs and the learnings that came out of this project.
